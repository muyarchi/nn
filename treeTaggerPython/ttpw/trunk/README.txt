Python wrapper for TreeTagger, a language independent part-of-speech tagger
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wrap the Helmut Schmid tool into a Python class allowing to tag several texts
one after the other, maintaining connexions with the tagger process to speed-up
processing.

Can do the chunking within the wrapper methods, or using an external tool (and
provide directly tokens to the tagger).

Using objects, can start multiple taggers simultaneously, eventually using
different languages.

Support chunking for:

  - english
  - french
  - deutch
  - spanish

This version is based on Python 2.

Module provide docstring documentation for use of the main class and its
methods.
